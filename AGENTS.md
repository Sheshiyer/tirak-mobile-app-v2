## Temperance project rail

This repository is registered with **Temperance Engine** as a project rail.
Host runtime (models, OmniRoute, OpenCode plugins) lives under `~/.temperance_engine`
and `~/.config/opencode`; this repo owns planning and acceptance.

| Concern | Authority |
|---|---|
| Models / failover / budgets | Host OmniRoute + temperance combos |
| Planning spine | `.planning/` (GSD) + `temperance-next-wave` |
| Human roadmap | one GitHub Project per repo (`temperance-gh-plan`) |
| Acceptance | `ISA.md` when present |
| Session loop | `/gsd:goal` → `.temperance/goal.json` (not a second planner) |
| Handoff (if present) | `.project/HANDOFF.md` |
| Parallel execute | `noesis-execute` / `temperance-batch` |

`/gsd:*` binds the mode. A card only on a bare first prompt with no saved session/cwd mode.

### Auto next-wave

When an agent session starts in this cwd, enrich injects `dispatch: NEXT-WAVE …`.
The injected next-wave is a proposal only. Do not dispatch until a matching
approval receipt has been atomically claimed by the swarm control ledger.

```bash
temperance-next-wave --cwd .
temperance-project-init --cwd . --check
manifest-bridge init --cwd .
manifest-bridge sync --cwd .
temperance-swarm-dispatch --request .planning/swarm-claim.json --dry-run
```

Manifest: `.temperance/project.json` (schema temperance.project.v1)
